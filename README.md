✈️ Flight Delay Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that builds and compares Regression and Classification models to predict flight delays based on various features like departure time, airline, origin, destination, and more.

📁 Contents:
Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Regression Model – predicts the number of minutes a flight will be delayed

Classification Model – classifies whether a flight is delayed (Yes/No)

Model evaluation and comparison using metrics like MAE, accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.

💡 Objective:
To explore and compare two different approaches (regression & classification) for solving the flight delay problem, and analyze which one fits better depending on the use case.

📚 Technologies Used:
Python

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Google Colab
